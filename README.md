# Notes
The handwritten notes are a compilation of my experiences and observations during my PhD at Duke in Prof. Jungsang Kim's lab. They include practical experimental tips and some (informal) mathematical derivations. References are provided alongside relevant content where applicable. Some experimental concepts originated from Yichao Yu, who has also verified the accuracy of these notes.

Should you encounter any inaccuracies or have suggestions for additions to these notes, please feel free to contact me at ke.sun@duke.edu.

Wishing you a fulfilling journey as an AMO experimentalist!

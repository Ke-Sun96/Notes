# Notes
The hand-writing note is summaried from my notes during the PhD at Duke in Prof. Jungsang Kim's lab. It contains experimental operation tips, and some (not rigorous) mathematical derevitions. The references used are listed next to the corresponding content, if applicable. Some experimental operation ideas are original from Yichao Yu. He also checked the accuracy of the notes.

If you find any mistakes inside the note, or do you have any ideas that want to add into this note, please contact me at ke.sun@duke.edu

Enjoy your life as an AMO experimentalist!
